            <p>Some people are less fortunate; life is not kind to all of us. While you might be lucky enough to live a
                comfortable
                life, others don’t have a roof over their head or food to put on the table. You won’t be able to help
                everyone
                in
                need, but your gesture, no matter how small, will definitely make a difference.</p>

        <h1>Let's Help Those Who are More In Need</h1>
        <p>Some people are less fortunate; life is not kind to all of us. While you might be lucky enough to live a
            comfortable
            life, others don’t have a roof over their head or food to put on the table. You won’t be able to help
            everyone
            in
            need, but your gesture, no matter how small, will definitely make a difference.</p>

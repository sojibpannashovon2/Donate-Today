            <p>Some people are less fortunate; life is not kind to all of us. While you might be lucky enough to live a
                comfortable
                life, others don’t have a roof over their head or food to put on the table. You won’t be able to help
                everyone
                in
                need, but your gesture, no matter how small, will definitely make a difference.</p>

                <h1>Their lives depand on your donation</h1>
                <p>Following natural disasters like a hurricane or earthquake, many people rely on the generosity of
                    strangers to help rebuild their lives. Donations to disaster relief organizations, local food and
                    diaper banks, and other charities can make a big difference to people in great need.However, we know
                    that not everyone who can donate to these organizations ends up opening their wallets. In fact, a
                    phenomenon known as compassion collapse (or fade) can make people less generous following
                    catastrophic situations—or any time we are faced with many people in need.Are there ways that
                    charities and individuals can help overcome our tendency to limit generosity? Fortunately, several
                    studies suggest that there are. Here are ten evidence-based methods for encouraging people to give
                    more to charity.</p>
